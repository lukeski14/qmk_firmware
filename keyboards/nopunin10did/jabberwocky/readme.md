# Jabberwocky

![Jabberwocky](https://diplomacyvariants.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/dexterous_jabberwocky.jpg)

A full-size, columnar-staggered, Alice-style keyboard. The Jabberwocky comes in two varieties currently: 
* Dexterous (with numpad on the right side, pictured above)
* Sinister (with numpad on the left side)

Both the Dexterous and Sinister use the same firmware.  The numpad and the four keys above it are simply transposed from the right to the left side of the board.
